Description: Seqpac provides functions and workflows for analysis of short 
    sequenced reads. It was originally developed for small RNA analysis, but 
    can be implemented on any sequencing raw data (provided as a fastq-file), 
    where the unit of measurement is counts of unique sequences. The core of 
    the seqpac workflow is the generation and subsequence analysis/visualization 
    of a standardized object called PAC. Using an innovative targeting system, 
    Seqpac process, analyze and visualize sample or sequence group differences 
    using the PAC object. A PAC object in its most basic form is a list 
    containing three types of data frames.
    - Phenotype table (P):
    Sample names (rows) with associated metadata (columns) e.g. treatment.
    - Annotation table (A): 
    Unique sequences (rows) with annotation (columns), eg. reference alignments.    
    - Counts table (C): 
    Counts of unique sequences (rows) for each sample (columns).
    The PAC-object follows the rule:
    - Row names in P must be identical with column names in C.
    - Row names in A must be identical with row names in C.
    Thus P and A describes the columns and rows in C, respectively. The 
    targeting system, will either target specific samples in P (pheno_target) 
    or sequences in A (anno_target) and group them according to a target column 
    in P and A, respectively (see vignettes for more details).
