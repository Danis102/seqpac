Description: Seqpac provides functions and a workflow for analysis of short sequenced reads. 
    It was originally developed for small RNA analysis, but can be implemented on 
    any sequencing raw data (provided as a fastq-file), where the unit of measurement 
    is counts of unique sequences. The core of the seqpac workflow is the generation and 
    subsequence analysis/visualization of a standardized object called PAC. Using an 
    innovative target system, Seqpac process, analyze and visualize group differences 
    using the PAC object.
    A PAC object in its most basic form is a list containing three types of data frames: 
    - Phenotype table (P): Sample names (rows) with associated metadata (columns) e.g. groups. 
    - Annotation table (A): Unique sequences (rows) with annotation (columns), eg. reference alignment.     
    - Counts table (C): Counts of unique sequences (rows) for each sample (columns).
    The PAC list-objects follow the rule:
    - Row names in P must be identical with column names in C.
    - Row names in A must be identical with row names in C.
    Thus P and A describes the columns and rows in C, respectively. The targeting system, will either 
    target specific samples in P (pheno_target) or sequences in A (anno_target) and group them according 
    to a target column in P and A, respectively (see vignettes for more details).
