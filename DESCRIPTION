Description: A collection of functions used for complete analysis of short sequenced reads. 
    The package was originally developed for small RNA analysis, but can be implemented on 
    any sequencing raw data (provided as a fastq-file) where intended unit of measurement 
    is counts of unique sequences. The core of the seqpac workflow is the generation and 
    subsequence analysis/visualization of a standardized list object called PAC. Using an 
    innovative target system, seqpac extracts, analyze and visualize group differences 
    using the PAC object.
    A PAC object in its most basic form is a list containing three types of data frames: 
    - Phenotype table (P): Sample names (rows) with associated metadata (columns) e.g. groups. 
    - Annotation table (A): Unique sequences (rows) with annotation (columns), eg. reference alignment.     
    - Counts table (C): Counts of unique sequences (rows) for each sample (columns).
    The PAC list-objects follow the rule:
    - Row names in P must be identical with column names in C.
    - Row names in A must be identical with row names in C.
    Thus P and A describes the columns and rows in C, respectively. The targeting system, will either 
    target specific samples in P (pheno_target) or sequences in A (anno_target) and group them according 
    to a target column in P and A, respectively.
